- Draw connectors
- Add support for editing nodes.
- Add support for saving the mindmap.
- Implement node selection/deselection using keyboard and mouse.
- Make xMargin and yMargin class constants. Individual nodes probably do not need their own custom margins.

LONG TERM
- Replace the call to drawText word-wrapping with a custom word wrapping routine.
    QString str = "Now: this sentence fragment.";
    QStringList list = str.split(QRegExp("\\b"), QString::SkipEmptyParts);
    // list: ["Now", ": ", "this", " ", "sentence", " ", "fragment", "." ]
    
- Create a separate Qt drawing primitives editor/playground. Add support for
drawing QPainter primitives as vector images. Allow tweaking of primitive
parameters along with rendering hints on a per object basis.

DONE
- Created a separate bezier curve editor.

- Display a border around the node widget for debugging purposes. - Change
layout properties to fix the internode space. The distance between the nodes
should not change with the size of MmWidget.

CANCELLED
- Create a NodeWidget which encapsulates a QLabel and a singleton
QTextEdit shared by all

- Replace QFontMetrics measurements with the bounding rect returned by
drawText. Create a node connector graphical editor with immediate feedback. 
REASON: QFontMetrics is close enough.
