LONG TERM
- Replace the call to drawText word-wrapping with a custom word wrapping routine.
    QString str = "Now: this sentence fragment.";
    QStringList list = str.split(QRegExp("\\b"), QString::SkipEmptyParts);
    // list: ["Now", ": ", "this", " ", "sentence", " ", "fragment", "." ]

DONE
- Display a border around the node widget for debugging purposes.
- Change layout properties to fix the internode space. The distance between the nodes should not change with the size of MmWidget.

CANCELLED
- Create a NodeWidget which encapsulates a QLabel and a singleton QTextEdit shared by all
